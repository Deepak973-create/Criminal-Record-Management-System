Sir,
My age is 25 as of now. I had valid voter ID card.
The ID card was lost while shifting my home last week.
I have tried all the way to trace out my Voter ID, but I was unsuccessful in finding it.
Hence I want to lodge a police complaint to file F.I.R.
Please take necessary steps to find it and give me a copy of FIR.
For any more information, I can be reachable at 8745963211 .
Thank you!
