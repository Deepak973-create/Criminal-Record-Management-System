I tried all possible ways to recover them. But could not able to find them till now. So I am reaching out to you to file an F.I.R. I have given a paper advertisement too to find my certificates. I have attached a copy of it here. Please file F.I.R for my loss of certificates (Write certificate numbers using xerox copy or attach them with the letter), which will make me to step forward to claim duplicate certificates from my university. In case, any further details are required from my end, you may please contact me through the phone number given above.
